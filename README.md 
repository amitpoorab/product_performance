Spark RDD, dataframe and Dataset API with some real world example
=======

This spark code is fully testable on local machine. This is great way of
writing quality spark code pretty fast.

# Overview
This repository demonstrates how to generate testable spark/scala code with an example of how to
generate product rankings for e-commerce.
The idea here is to use product performance and other metadata indicators as an indicator of those
product's future rankings.

This is a relatively simple algorithm, primarily designed for learning how to produce testable Spark Scala code.

# Run tests
    SBT clean assembly
